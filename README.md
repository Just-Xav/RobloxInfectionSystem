# RobloxInfectionSystem


A modular, scalable infection and mutation system designed for Roblox multiplayer games. Players can be infected, mutate over time, and be cured or killed — with full dev/testing support via chat commands and part-based triggers.

## 📁 Features

- 🧍‍♂️ **Player Class Logic:** Each infected player is tracked separately with their own timer.
- 🌐 **Supports Multiple Players:** Each infection runs independently.
- 💬 **Dev Chat Commands:** `!infect`, `!cure`, and `!kill` (supports "me" or player name).
- 🎮 **Infection Part:** Touch a part to get infected (safe logic, no cooldown abuse).
- 🧹 **Custom Maid Cleanup:** All tasks, events, and visuals are cleaned on cure/death.
- 🧪 **Mock Effects Ready:** Placeholder for particles or sounds at each stage.
