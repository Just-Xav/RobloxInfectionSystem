# RobloxInfectionSystem


A modular, scalable infection and mutation system designed for Roblox multiplayer games. Players can be infected, mutate over time, and be cured or killed — with full dev/testing support via chat commands and part-based triggers.

## 📁 Features

-  **Tick-Based Mutation:** Players progress through stages every 45 seconds (0 -> 4).
-  **Player Class Logic:** Each infected player is tracked separately with their own timer.
-  **Supports Multiple Players:** Each infection runs independently.
-  **Dev Chat Commands:** `!infect`, `!cure`, and `!kill` (supports "me" or player name).
-  **Infection Part:** Touch a part to get infected (safe logic, no cooldown abuse).
-  **Custom Maid Cleanup:** All tasks, events, and visuals are cleaned on cure/death.
-  **Mock Effects Ready:** Placeholder for particles or sounds at each stage.
